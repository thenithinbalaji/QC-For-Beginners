## Why Quantum computers are the future?

### What's a transistor?

The transistor is the primary building block of all microchips, including your CPU (central processing unit). It is what creates the binary 0's and 1's (bits) your computer uses to communicate and deal with Boolean logic. When placed in different configurations, transistors form logic gates, which can combine into arrays called half adders that also combine into full adders.   
It is a miniature semiconductor that regulates or controls current or voltage flow in addition to amplifying and generating these electrical signals and acting as a **switch/gate** for them.

### Moore's Law and Quantum Tunnelling

Moore's law is a term used to refer to the observation made by Gordon Moore in 1965 that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years i.e. transistors will become small and small.   

This process will hit a threshold where the transistor can no longer be used to control the flow of electrons.  

There is this phenomenon called <b>Quantum Tunnelling</b>. Quantum tunneling is a quantum mechanical phenomenon whereby a wave function can propagate through a potential barrier.  

So, once the transistor reaches a threshold size, it can no longer be used to control the flow of electrons since electrons will pass straight through them via QT.  

This brings us to computers that don't use transistors, **THE QUANTUM COMPUTERS.**

## How Quantum computers?

### Intro

Classical computers carry out logical operations using the definite position of a physical state. These are usually binary, meaning their operations are based on one of two positions. A single state - such as on or off, up or down, 1 or 0 - is called a bit.    

In quantum computing, operations instead use the quantum state of an object to produce what's known as a **qubit**. These states are the undefined properties of an object before they've been detected, such as **the spin of an electron or the polarization of a photon.**    

### Qubit

In quantum computing, a qubit or quantum bit is a basic unit of quantum information—the quantum version of the classic binary bit physically realized with a two-state device. A qubit is a two-state quantum-mechanical system, one of the simplest quantum systems displaying the peculiarity of quantum mechanics. These states are the undefined properties of an object before they've been detected, such as **the spin of an electron or the polarization of a photon.**

So, qubits exist in both 0 and 1 state (called <b>superposition</b> state) before it is measured.

**Superposition is the ability of a quantum system to be in multiple states at the same time until it is measured.**   

But from the point of view of classical physics, this theory can be seen as counter-intuitive or even bizarre. Quantum objects appear to be at two places at the same time, electrical currents in a metallic wire can flow clockwise and counter-clockwise at the same time, or an object can sometimes behave as a wave and sometimes a particle.   

Even a Nobel laureate like Richard Feynman struggled with the implications of quantum mechanics, which led to his famous quote:   

```
I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics
Richard Feynman

Rebecca Krauthamer, CEO of quantum computing consultancy Quantum Thought, compares quantum computing to a crossroads that allows a traveler to take both paths. “If you’re trying to solve a maze, you’d come to your first gate, and you can go either right or left,” she said. “We have to choose one, but a quantum computer doesn’t have to choose one. It can go right and left at the same time.”
