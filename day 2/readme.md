# Setting up Qiskit

## What is Qiskit?

Qiskit is an open-source software development kit for working with quantum computers at the level of circuits, pulses, and algorithms. It provides tools for creating and manipulating quantum programs and running them on prototype quantum devices on IBM Quantum Experience or on simulators on a local computer.

## How to setup?

Highly recommend you to watch this   
[How to install Qiskit by Qiskit's Official YouTube](https://youtu.be/M4EkW4VwhcI)  

Notes before watching the video:
+ You can skip Anaconda installation if you don't have any other python modules installed in your pc whose version may conflict with Qiskit's dependencies. 
+ You can run Jupyter Notebook in VS Code using Jupyter Notebook extension. 
+ [https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/) -> this website is damn slow (used in video for getting IBMQ Key) 
+ You can skip the "getting key to run your code on IBM's Quantum Computer" part if you want your computer to run your code instead of IBM's Quantum computer.
